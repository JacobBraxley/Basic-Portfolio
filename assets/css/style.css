Bonus


Make your pages more sophisticated by adding style to text links, to image links, and to buttons for when a user hovers their cursor over them. A CSS hover tutorial can be 
found here.
You can use Adobe Kuler to find colors that match the theme (in this case, the primary color is Teal #4aaaa5).

Make a "sticky footer." You will notice the dark grey footer will always rest just below the content. This is fine whenever your site has enough content to push it down past 
the height of most monitors. But if there isn't much content in the body, the footer could rest in the middle of the page:


Try to code the footer in a way that it will always remain at the bottom of the page, no matter how short the content is. A sticky footer tutorial can be found here.
Give the Footer the following CSS:
border-top: 8px solid #4aaaa5;
